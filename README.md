# Online Shop
Java web application based on Spring MVC and Data Access Object (DAO) design pattern. It is a completely functional online store with role-based access control. To create the application I used following:
•	Spring (Core, MVC, Security)
•	Hibernate and JPA	
•	MySQL	
•	JSP technology
•	Tomcat 8	
•	Maven tool	
•	JSTL	
•	jQuery plugins (DataTables and Validate)
•	Front-End layer: customized Bootstrap (CSS + JavaScript)	
•	few auxiliary functions in JavaScript language		 

## How does it look like?
