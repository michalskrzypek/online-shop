<h2>About me</h2>

<div>
Hi :) My name is <b>Michal Skrzypek</b> and I am beginner Java programmer. I created this project to check my skill set and learn new skills regarding Java EE. I started my journey with programming exactly one year ago at the "programming" classes at my university. Then I got to know complete basics, such as Primitive Data Types, what is a class, what is an object, what is an interface etc. One year ago I was complete novice, but I really fell in love with programming and started to work on this field and improve my skills. Throughout this one year I have been programming Java web applications, GUI apps and Android mobile apps. This is my first project with the use of <b>Spring framework</b> and <b>Hibernate</b>. Next step for me is to learn what is <b>Spring webflow</b> and how it works. After getting to know that, I will improve the whole checkout process by utilizing webflow instead of traditional Spring MVC. Stay tuned :)
<br>
<br>
I am eagerly looking for my first real-life experience as a Java developer. If you can make my dream come true - feel free to contact me: <b><i>skrzypekmichal@yahoo.com</i></b>
<br>
<br>
Best regards,
Michal Skrzypek
